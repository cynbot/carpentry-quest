## **MASTER PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE: CARPENTRY QUEST**

**Project Overview:**
Create "Carpentry Quest" - a gamified carpentry apprenticeship preparation platform for someone starting from absolute zero. The user's partner loves red, motorcycles, Elden Ring, and going fast. They need to go from "never touched a tape measure" to union-ready in the most engaging way possible.

**CRITICAL FIRST INSTRUCTION:**
Read the skills at `/mnt/skills/public/` to understand best practices for creating a high-quality web application before starting.

### **PHASE 1: Core Architecture & Skill Tree (Week 1)**

Build the foundation with these specifications:

**Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend (auth, database, progress tracking)
- PWA setup for mobile use on job sites
- Local storage for offline capability

**Database Schema:**
```
Users (id, email, created_at, current_xp, total_hours_practiced)
Skills (id, name, category, required_xp, parent_skill_ids[], icon)
UserSkills (user_id, skill_id, level[0-4], xp_progress, unlocked_at)
Achievements (id, name, description, icon, xp_reward, requirement_type)
UserAchievements (user_id, achievement_id, earned_at)
DailyChallenges (id, date, challenges[3], completed_by_users[])
PracticeSession (user_id, skill_id, duration, xp_earned, accuracy_score)
```

**Skill Tree Visualization:**
Create an Elden Ring-inspired branching skill tree with 6 main paths:
1. **Safety & Foundation** (PREREQUISITE FOR ALL)
2. **Measurement Mastery** (Math & Measuring)
3. **Tool Proficiency** (Hand → Power tools)
4. **Material Knowledge** (Wood → Concrete → Steel)
5. **Construction Systems** (Framing → Finishing)
6. **Blueprint Reading** (Basic → Advanced)

Each skill node shows:
- Current level (0-4 stars)
- XP progress bar (fills with red gradient)
- Required parent skills (connected by glowing paths)
- Hours practiced counter
- "Motorcycle speedometer" style circular progress indicator

**Visual Theme:**
```css
Primary Red: #C41E3A
Dark Charcoal: #2C3E50
Metallic Silver: #B8B8B8
Sand Accent: #F4E5C2
Success Green: #27AE60
Warning Orange: #FF6B35
```

Background: Subtle garage/workshop texture
UI Elements: Industrial/mechanical aesthetic with bolt details
Fonts: Bold industrial for headers, clean sans for body

### **PHASE 2: The Tape Measure Trainer (Week 2)**

**THIS IS THE KILLER FEATURE - Build it perfectly!**

- Skills Progressing Toward Level 3+ (proficient)

### **INITIAL DATA TO PRELOAD:**

Include these in the initial database:
- 500+ measurement challenges
- 300+ fraction problems  
- 200+ Pythagorean theorem scenarios
- 100+ safety violation photos
- 50+ blueprint samples
- OSHA Focus Four complete content
- Tool identification for 50 essential tools

### **START WITH THIS TEST:**

Create a simple "How ready are you?" diagnostic that tests:
1. Can you read a tape measure? (5 measurements)
2. Can you add fractions? (5 problems)
3. Do you know basic tools? (10 identifications)
4. Do you understand job site safety? (5 scenarios)

Score determines starting point in skill tree and recommends first modules.

### **REMEMBER:**
Your users are adults starting from ZERO. No assumptions about prior knowledge. Every feature should be:
- Immediately useful for getting a union job
- Engaging enough to practice daily
- Accurate to real industry requirements
- Respectful of adult learners
- Focused on the 20% of skills that matter 80% of the time

Build this iteratively, test each feature, and make it FAST and SMOOTH. The partner likes speed - make everything responsive and snappy. Use red accents throughout but don't overdo it. Think "high-performance garage" aesthetic.

Start with Phase 1, get authentication working, then build the tape measure trainer as the showcase feature. Everything else builds from there.

Good luck! This is going to change someone's life! 🔨

There you go! This prompt gives Claude Code everything needed to build something genuinely useful while keeping it fun and engaging. The tape measure trainer alone could be a standalone app - it's that important. Want me to adjust anything before you hand it off?
