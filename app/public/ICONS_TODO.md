# PWA Icons TODO

The PWA is configured but needs icon files. Create the following icons in the `/public` directory:

## Required Icons:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
   - Red hammer icon on dark charcoal background
   - Use the #C41E3A red color
   - Should be clear and recognizable at small sizes

2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)
   - Same design as 192px version
   - Higher resolution for splash screens

3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180 pixels)
   - For iOS home screen
   - Same design

## Design Suggestions:

- Simple red hammer silhouette
- Dark charcoal (#2C3E50) background
- Metallic (#B8B8B8) accent if needed
- Industrial/bold style matching the app aesthetic

## Tools to Create Icons:

- Figma/Canva (easiest)
- GIMP/Photoshop
- Online icon generators like https://realfavicongenerator.net/

## Temporary Solution:

The app will work without icons, but won't look polished when installed on mobile.
For now, the PWA functionality is configured and ready once icons are added.
